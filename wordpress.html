										<h2><a href="#">WP Travel</a></h2>

									<p>WP Travel has been quite a challenging and an exciting journey from scratch. Imagine designing a complete theme out of sheer Adobe Photoshop. Then coding the designs with Bootstrap, making it responsive and improving load time efficiency. 
									</p>
									<p>
									Then comes the Wordpress magic. Making ample of errors helped me learned the right ways to make plugins and themes with Wordpress. From using AJAX with Wordpress, to shortcodes, widgets, custom post types, content filters to cron jobs, everything was used in this project. From learning to use WP_Options to WP_Query and much more to grasp wholesome view of Wordpress development. Intentionally used several ways to interact with data, so that I could be job-ready with Wordpress.
									</p>
									<p>
									I have coded this project two times for learning purposes, as things were getting very tricky during development. So it was important to get hold of the concepts and firmly understand the nitty gritty details to be able to serve as an asset to any company.
									</p>
									<p>
									While people consider Wordpress easy, that's probably because of available plugins and ready-made solutions. However, it was not the case in this project. It's by far my most challenging project, the most difficult learning curve, in terms of understanding how things work and implementing right solutions. 
									</p>
									<p>
									The best Wordpress magic comes under the admin section, where you can change images, color, titles and make all front-end customizations from both Customizer and a settings page. Such as site title to become a logo is just a setting away. The ability for users to submit travel guest posts and it directly goes under the Travel posts pending section for review. Having different layouts for pages, including footer widgets or decluding without breaking any changes, responsive drop-down menus, quick edit to check/uncheck a travel post featured  and much more. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Having said all that, it is just the beggining. Because when we learn more, we realize how much more we have to learn to become an expert. Will work over a few corrections in coming weeks, but the whole point was to offer a solid background in Wordpress to be able to understand, find solutions and implement while working as a part of a team.
									</p>

									Breaking the ice, here are the image designs and coded versions of the same.
