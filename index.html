									<h3>It enables innate ability to create great things.</h3>

									<h2>Technology excites ME</h2>
									
									<p>The satisfaction of creating a meaningful product that helps people is immense. Being a creative individual, who is always thirsty to learn more, design/development soon became second nature. 
										The advancements in technology keeps me positively humble, knowing no one can learn everything. But one should be able to seek right information, learn from it and understand to implement to grow his skills. It gives you the right attitude to work with people and respect those who have worked hard to become who they are.  </p>

								<h2>My Journey</h2>
								<p>Having freelanced as a writer, professionally served as a Search Engine Optimizer and lately pursuing Master's in Marketing helped me to connect the dots. Effective communication is a valuable skill, that translates in to visual elements and smart usability decisions. I was firmly convinced, while some may consider it becoming a jack of all, I was on a unique path to be able to understand the bigger picture to better commuunicate with the team and take charge of creating great products. </p>
							
								<h2>In an Endeavour</h2>

								<p>What was once a hobby, now is an integral part of my skills. Back in 2009, I did a 3-years IT course as a hobby. There was this desire to understand more of how things work, to be able to freelance in creative field.</p>

								<p>Having a natural zeal towards communication made me love marketing. From understanding the concept of a brand key to creating a complete brand profile; had quite a number of achievements in marketing. I always remained fascinated by IT though. It was when I realized, my keen interest lies in IT while taking advantage of a creative thought process to be able to prove as a valuable asset to company.</p>

								<p>In such a circumstrance, am reaching out for a remote job to work with growing mindsets. </p>
